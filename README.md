# Calculator
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Project - Calculator
- Project objective was to create a functional basic calculator to practice HTML/CSS/JS skills
- Focus was on utilizing foundations of HTML/CSS/JS to handle more complex data and functions
- Skills: CSS Grid, DOM Manipulation, functions, event listeners, handling multiple data values, nested functions
- CSS used to re-create a version of TI-108, a commonly used calculator in elementary school's in the 90s

Reflection for project:
- Increased confidence in writing code / debugging without consulting external resources
- More comfortable working with event listeners and setting up nested functions
- Most difficult portion of project was correctly saving each operand and having those values work within my functions without producing NaNs or incorrect values
- Look for ways to be more efficient with code in future projects. Logic was re-used for example when creating code to process one pair of numbers at a time when multiple operators were being used. Possible way to reduce lines of code.
